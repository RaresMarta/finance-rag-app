Get Project Done â€“ Journal

First, try and run Pisco's app

1. pip install all dependencies -> crash, dependency problems
    - spent ~10 min trying to fix what seemed code logic error
    - no success

2. run project in venv with fresh dependencies
    - missing c++ build tools needed for Llama LLM (LlamaCpp runs a C++ model backend)
    - installing vs_BuildTools
    - rebooting pc 21:06

    - reactivated venv
    - try installing the C++-dependent package again
        `pip install llama-cpp-python`
    - 21:12 done

    - installing remaining dependencies
        `pip install streamlit requests certifi python-certifi-win32 langchain langchain-community chromadb gpt4all`
    - 21:16 done

    - ran project in venv with streamlit run bares.py
    - 21:20 streamlit app started with errors
    - embedding step failed due to SSL certificate verification error when trying to download the PDF

    - 21:29 problem: local certificate issue (very common on Windows)
    - ðŸŽ‰ FIX: manually downloaded the PDF and loaded it locally using PyPDFLoader
    
3. Assess missing points
    - 21:57 - 22:17 extracted insights

Goals:
- add custom file input
